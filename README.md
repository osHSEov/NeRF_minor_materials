#NeRF Minor — Materials

Materials for hands‑on practice with Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) used in a neural networks minor.

In the first Jupyter notebook:
● A basic approach to scene rendering was implemented using volume integration. Ray paths, camera positions, and directions were visualized;
● The NeRF lego dataset was processed;
● The model was trained using positional encoding and MLP;
● A variant of Voxel NeRF was implemented: utilizing a voxel grid and accelerating sampling.

The second notebook demonstrates:
● Installing and configuring NeRFstudio;
● Importing and preparing the dataset;
● Training the model using predefined parameters;
● Rendering results and analyzing quality.
